 * - CTEs for complex multi-step aggregations
 * - Proper indexing strategies
 * - Efficient NULL handling
 * 
 * Performance considerations:
 * - Uses raw SQL for complex aggregations (10-100x faster than ORM)
 * - Leverages database indexes on userId, exitDate, symbol, side
 * - Minimizes data transfer by aggregating in database
 * - Returns pre-formatted data for direct chart consumption
