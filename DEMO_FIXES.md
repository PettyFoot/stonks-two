# Demo Button and Text Color Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Demo Button Not Working
**Problem**: The "View Demo" button on the login page was using a Link component pointing to `/demo`, which caused a redirect loop.

**Solution**:
- Changed from `Link` component to `Button` with `onClick` handler
- Added the same `startDemo` function as the landing page
- Added loading state with spinner while creating demo session
- Improved error handling with console logging

### 2. ✅ Text Color Visibility Issues  
**Problem**: Button text appeared white on light backgrounds causing readability issues.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit `bg-white` and `text-[var(--theme-primary-text)]` classes to demo button
- Ensured proper color contrast for all buttons
- Maintained existing correct styling for Sign In button (white text on blue background)

### 3. ✅ Demo Session Creation Issues
**Problem**: Demo sessions might not have been created properly due to configuration mismatches.

**Solution**:
- Updated session password to ensure minimum 32-character length
- Added `path: '/'` to cookie options for site-wide availability
- Added comprehensive logging to API route for debugging
- Improved error responses with detailed error messages

### 4. ✅ Middleware Demo Detection
**Problem**: Middleware wasn't properly detecting demo sessions, causing authentication failures.

**Solution**:
- Synchronized session configuration between middleware and API routes
- Added logging to track demo session detection
- Improved routing logic to redirect demo users to dashboard if accessing invalid routes
- Better error handling for Auth0 middleware failures

## Test Results

The demo system now works correctly:
- ✅ Demo session API creates sessions successfully 
- ✅ Sessions are properly saved to cookies
- ✅ Correct redirect URLs are returned
- ✅ Button text is now properly visible
- ✅ No more redirect loops

## How to Test

1. Go to http://localhost:3002/login
2. Click the "View Demo" button in the left panel
3. Should see loading spinner and then redirect to dashboard
4. Demo banner should appear at the top
5. All features should work in read-only mode
