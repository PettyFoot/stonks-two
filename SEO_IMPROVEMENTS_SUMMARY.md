## üé® Next Step: OpenGraph Image

### Create the Social Sharing Image
I've created an HTML template at `/public/og-image.html` for you to generate the OpenGraph image.

**Steps to create og-image.png:**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/og-image.html` in your browser
2. Set browser window to exactly 1200x630px
3. Take a screenshot
4. Save as `/public/og-image.png`
5. Update `src/lib/seo.ts`:
   ```typescript
   defaultImage: '/og-image.png',  // Change from '/trade-voyager-logo.png'
   ```

**Alternative:** Use a design tool like Figma or Canva with these specs:
- Size: 1200x630px
- Background: Linear gradient from #2b4140 to #1a2827
- Include: Logo, "TRADE VOYAGER ANALYTICS", "Trading Journal", tagline
